# Harvard CS50 Exercises in JavaScript
This is my repository for exercises taken from the Harvard CS50 Course. 
Since I am learning JavaScript I am adapting the exercises somewhat. 

1. Mario Pyramid - 
Take user input as the height of a half-pyramid (right-justified).
Input must be greater than zero and less that 24, inclusive.

2. Change Maker - 
Determines the smallest amount of coins necessary to make change. 
The change is set to user input. 

3. Credit -
Determines whether a credit card number is valid, and what type of card it is. 
Only works for Amex, MasterCard, and Visa.
