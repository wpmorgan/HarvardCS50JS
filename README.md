# Harvard CS50 Exercises in JavaScript
This is my repository for exercises taken from the Harvard CS50 Course. 
Since I am learning JavaScript I am adapting the exercises somewhat. 

1. Mario Pyramid - 
Take user input to make the height of a half-pyramid (right-justified).
Input must be greater than zero and less that 24, inclusive.

2. Change Maker - 
Determines the smallest amount of coins necessary to make change. 
The change is set to user input. 

3. Credit -
Determines whether a credit card number is valid, and what type of card it is. 
Only works for Amex, MasterCard, and Visa. 

4. Caesar - 
Enciphers a message input by the user by shifting the character code according to the second user input. 
Capital / lower-case and punctuation are not changed.

5. Vigenere - 
Enciphers a message input by the user by shifting the character code according the user input from a second prompt.
The second prompt asks for alphabetic input and shifts each character of the message according to the 
code of characters in the second prompt in order.

6. Search - 
Takes input from the user (guess) and checks a randomly generated array of 5 number to see if it's included.
